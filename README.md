# Md-Mahfuzul-Hasan
With over 5 years of dedicated research experience, I have contributed significantly to the field of agricultural sciences, publishing 12 original research articles and many more are in pipeline. My work focuses on sustainable agriculture, climate impacts on agriculture, consumer perception, food security, and supply chain systems. Currently serving as a Research Assistant in the ACASA project at the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council, I specialize in econometric analysis, with additional footprint on GIS and crop modeling. My goal is to leverage data-driven insights to enhance community well-being, promote sustainable agricultural practices, and advance innovation in the agricultural sector.
